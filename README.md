### Hey there 👋 
My name is Christopher Aitken, and I'm a senior software developer based in [New Orleans, LA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans).  

I particularly enjoy developing serverless apps on AWS using ⚛️React, 📦Node.js, 🐘PostgreSQL.  
I also build custom AI integrations using OpenAI, Bedrock, and 📐pgVector.  

If you're interested in learning more, visit my portfolio website at [heythisischris.com](https://heythisischris.com), or shoot me an email via [c@htic.io](mailto:c@htic.io).

Cheers!
